Kumar wants to learn how the calculators are working.so he is trying to implements the calculator program.could you please help him to implements the program. - Notes:- Must use the Switch Case.operators - Addition - Subtraction - Multiplication - Division - Modulo

Input Format

First input consists of integer.
Second input consists of integer.
third input consists of character.
Constraints

No Constraints

Output Format

#code
7.# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# Calculator program using match-case (Python's version of switch-case)

# Input
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
op = input().strip()

# Switch-case implementation
match op:
    case '+':
        print(f"Addition of two number is {a + b:.1f}")
    case '-':
        print(f"Subtraction of two number is {a - b:.1f}")
    case '*':
        print(f"Multiplication of two number is {a * b:.1f}")
    case '/':
        # Handle divide by zero
        if b != 0:
            print(f"Division of two number is {a / b:.1f}")
        else:
            print("Division by Zero Error")
    case '%':
        # Handle modulo by zero
        if b != 0:
            print(f"Modulo of two number is {a % b:.1f}")
        else:
            print("Modulo by Zero Error")
    case _:
        print("Invalid Input")
